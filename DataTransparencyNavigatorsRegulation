One of the issues with big data is that most people do not understand what personal data are being tracked and how those data are being used.
This proposal is to develop regulation requiring certain companies to disclose what data they have tracked on each person in a standardized, most likely XML-based, format.
The government could work to create the standard and perhaps develop additional rules about how companies must store the data. There could also potentially be rules that enable users to delete some or all of their non-public data from a company's databases. 
Finally, the government should work to encourage an industry of "big data navigators"--websites that advise people on how to approach and understand their data, and easily make more informed decisions on what data they are providing to companies.
The navigator websites will help citizens understand the costs and benefits of giving companies personal data. They will then help these citizens more easily decide whether providing personal data to each company that requests it is worth the benefit they are receiving from that company.

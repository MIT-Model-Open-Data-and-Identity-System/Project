Leading up to the [IDESG Plenary and BigDataDialog Hangout on Big Data and Identity](https://www.idecosystem.org/wiki/BigDataIdentity), it will be helpful to write up an indentity-related description of ClearButton with emphasis on use of OpenID Connect, aspects of BlueButton+ and the centrality of user-centered identity and account management for the use of neutral functional infrastructural registry services modeled on do-not-call registries and mobile number portability registries. Gold stars to any contributors that can concisely describe how ClearButton registry services for individual identity and personal data can provide fair information practices in a Big Data world by ensuring individual-centered identifier and end-point connection control with recourse rights at the same time as respecting industry-centered property rights and competitive interests.  These facets of ClearButton reflect material aspects of the IDESG mission to develop a balanced identity ecosystem and provide examples of how infrastructure services provided on a low markup quasi utility basis can form essential elements of a larger working marketplace.
